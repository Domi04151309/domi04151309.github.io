		<h2>What is Arduino?</h2>
		<p>
			Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
			Arduino boards are able to read inputs and turn it into an output.
			You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.<br><br>
			<i>To the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino Homepage</a></i>
		</p>
		<h2>About the Library</h2>
		<p>
			This library is made for programmers who want a more advanced tone function. It was developed by Dominik Reichl in 2018 and designed for the Arduino Uno.<br>
			This library is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>
			<i>You can download the library <a href="https://github.com/Domi04151309/Arduino-Notes">here</a></i>
		</p>
		<h2>How to Install</h2>
		<p>
			1. Download the repository from GitHub<br>
			2. Unzip it<br>
			3. Copy the "Notes" folder into your library folder<br>
			4. Open Arduino IDE<br>
			5. Click on Sketch &gt Include Library &gt Notes<br>
			Done!
		</p>
		<h2>Functions</h2>
			<pre>Notes n(param1, param2)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = time beat-LED blinks<br>
			param2 = space between notes<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<pre>n.speakerSetup(param1)</pre>
		<pre>n.speakerSetup(param1, param2)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = pin of the speaker<br>
			param2 = beats per minute (default is 120)<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<pre>n.toneLEDSetup(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7, param8)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = pin of the beat-LED<br>
			param2 = pin of the c-LED<br>
			param3 = pin of the d-LED<br>
			param4 = pin of the e-LED<br>
			param5 = pin of the f-LED<br>
			param6 = pin of the g-LED<br>
			param7 = pin of the a-LED<br>
			param8 = pin of the b-LED<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<pre>n.toneLEDState()</pre>
		<pre>n.toneLEDState(param1)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = ON or OFF for the tone LEDs (default is on)<br>
			At sketch start this is set to off<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<pre>n.blinkLED(param1)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = pin of the LED you want to blink<br>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<pre>n.note(param1, param2)</pre>
		<pre>n.note(param1, param2, param3, param4)</pre>
		<p>
			param1 = frequency of the tone you want to play<br>
			param2 = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 8 for the length<br>
			param3 = true for a dotted note, false for a normal note (default is false)<br>
			param4 = true for asynchronous beat-LED, false for normal beat-LED (default is false)<br>
			<i>For param1 you can also use keywords which you can find <a href="./pitches">here</a></i>
		</p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>
			You can find examples <a href="./examples">here</a> and in the library.
			The examples show you how to use this library and what you can do with it.
			It also has an example circuit.<br><br><br>
