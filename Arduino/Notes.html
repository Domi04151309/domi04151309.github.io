    <h2>What is Arduino?</h2>
    <p>
      Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
      Arduino boards are able to read inputs and turn it into an output.
      You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board.<br><br>

    <h2>About the Library</h2>
    <p>
      This library is made for programmers who want a more advanced tone function. It was developed by Dominik Reichl in 2018 and designed for the Arduino Uno.<br>
      This library is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>
      <i>You can download the library <a href="https://github.com/Domi04151309/Arduino-Notes">here</a></i>
    </p>
    <h2>How to Install</h2>
    <p>
      1. Download the repository from GitHub<br>
      2. Unzip it<br>
      3. Copy the "Arduino-Notes-master" folder into your library folder<br>
      4. Open the Arduino IDE<br>
      5. Click on Sketch &gt Include Library &gt Notes<br>
      Done!
