        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in programming, and I think that developing new things is a lot of fun.
          I am also always open to new technologies and techniques to develop great products and deliver amazing user experiences with nice looking user interfaces.
          Taking and editing pictures is something I like as well, which is why you will find the best ones on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/domi04151309/">Instagram</a>.
          Improvement suggestions are always welcome, so if you want to make some feel free to do so.

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
          I develop a lot of websites, which is why I know
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language">HTML</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> quite well.
          For some backend tricks, I also know a little bit about
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">PHP</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)">Jekyll</a> because they speed up development significantly.
          Because I developed a couple of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> apps I know
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">Kotlin</a> too, although I prefer using
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">Kotlin</a>.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino Boards</a> are great for some experimenting, which is why I have some experience in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> as well.

        <p>
          You may be wondering what these numbers in my name mean.
          It is easier than you think.
          You can take them as pairs so that you have the following numbers: 04 15 13 09.<br>
          Now let us take a closer look at these numbers.
          We can take these numbers and see which is the corresponding letter in the alphabet.
          After that, we get the word "Domi".
          As you see, there is not a big secret hiding behind those numbers.
