        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am interested in programming and I think that developing new things is a lot of fun.
          My programming skills are average, but I can do quite a lot with them.
          Taking and editing pictures is something I like as well, which is why you will find some further down on this page and Instagram.

        <h2>My Username</h2>
        <p>
          You may be wondering what these numbers in my name mean.
          It is easier than you think.
          You can take them as pairs so that you have the following numbers: 04 15 13 09.<br>
          Now let us take a closer look at these numbers.
          We can take these numbers and see which is the corresponding letter in the alphabet.
          After that, we get the word "Domi".<br>
          As you see, there is not a big secret hiding behind those numbers.

        <p>
          On Instagram, you can find some pictures I took with my smartphone.
          Some of them were taken with the OnePlus 3 and some with the OnePlus 6T.
          As you can see, I like taking pictures a lot, which is why I post the best ones on Instagram.

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
          I develop a lot of websites, which is why I know
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language">HTML</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> quite well.

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)">Jekyll</a> because they speed up development significantly.
          Because I developed a couple of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> apps I know
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">Kotlin</a> too, although I prefer using

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino Boards</a> are great for some experimenting, which is why I have some experience in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and
